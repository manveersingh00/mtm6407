# Clues in the Surrounding Area

You step back from the temple and begin to examine the area around it. The ground is covered in fallen leaves, and the air is filled with the sounds of nature. As you move carefully, you notice faint trails leading in different directions, as if others have walked here before.

You spot several interesting clues:
- A small piece of parchment half-buried in the dirt, marked with strange symbols.
- Footprints leading towards the dense forest on the eastern side.
- A peculiar arrangement of stones that seems too deliberate to be natural.
