# Explore the Side Chamber

You step into the side chamber, the air thick with dust and the scent of old relics. The chamber is dimly lit, but the center of the room draws your attention immediately—a pedestal holding a glowing crystal. The crystal emits a soft, ethereal light, casting strange shadows on the walls. Its glow seems to pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat, as though it holds some form of life within it.

Around the room are various ancient artifacts—ceremonial masks, tarnished weapons, and old scrolls that lie scattered across the floor. Each piece appears to tell a story of the past, a lost civilization's forgotten glory. As you step forward to examine the crystal, your eyes are drawn to a rusted door partially hidden behind some debris in the corner of the room.
